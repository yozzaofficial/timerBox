BoxTimer is a web app created from the idea of having a customizable timer for boxing practice.
The main feature allows the user to individually set the duration of each round. What makes BoxTimer unique is the SubTimer option â€” a feature that lets users divide the work time of each round into smaller sections. This allows the app to fully adapt to the user's specific workout needs.

Example workout:

4 Rounds

1 min work

30 sec rest

With SubTimer:

1 min work divided into:

20 sec jabs

20 sec cross

20 sec jab-cross
